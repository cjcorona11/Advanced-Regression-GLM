# glm-regression-project

In this project, we explore the relationship between drinking and self-esteem. The motivation for this project comes from the 2008 study by Tracy DeHart "Drinking to regulate negative romatic relationship interactions: the moderating role of self-esteem". The data set measures the number of drinks consumed for each participant in the study, contains 623 observations with 4 categorical and 9 quantitative variables. The goal of this project is to showcase thorough statistical analysis for GLM regression. We start with an exploratory data analysis which leads to the conclusion that we need to fit a GLM using Poisson or Negative Binomial distributions. We also decide that a random effect on individual is necessary due to the repeated measures in the data set. Based on the research question, we demonstrate how to fit models to make the appropriate inferences. We also check model assumptions with diagnostic plots to make sure our statistical methods are valid. Finally, we interpret the model and make visualization of the predictions. All R code is attached in the appendix and the data set is included in this repository.
